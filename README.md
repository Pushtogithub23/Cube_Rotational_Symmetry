# Cube Rotational Symmetry Visualization

This repository uses Python to explore and visualise the rotational symmetry elements of a cube. The project demonstrates how a cube remains invariant when rotated about specific symmetry axes by certain angles.

## Overview

The project visualizes three main types of rotational symmetry axes in a cube:

1. **4-fold Axis of Symmetry(Tetrad)**: (3 axes)
   - Passing through centres of opposite faces
   - 90°, 180°, 270° rotations

2. **2-fold Axis of Symmetry(Diad)**: (6 axes)
   - Passing through midpoints of opposite edges
   - 180° rotations

3. **3-fold Axis of Symmetry(Triad)**: (4 axes)
   - Passing through opposite vertices
   - 120° and 240° rotations
